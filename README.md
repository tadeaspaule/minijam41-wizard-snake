# minijam41-wizard-snake
My submission for Mini Jam 41 (https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-41-magic).

A twist on the classical Snake game; there are potions you can drink for special effects, walls that spawn to block your path, and nasty traps to avoid!

## Game restrictions
- Your game must take place in one screen (set by jam)
- 128x128 resolution (set by me; was one of the options for the jam and I really liked it so here we go!)
